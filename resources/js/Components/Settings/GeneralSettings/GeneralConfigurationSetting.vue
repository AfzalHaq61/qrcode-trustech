     <div class="px-5 py-4">
        <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is
        hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate
        classes that we use to style each element. These classes control
        the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
        transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or
        overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just
        about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>,
        though the transition does limit overflow.
